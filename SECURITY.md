## Security Best Practices for Deployers

### Supabase Credentials
- **Never** commit real `SUPABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` values to version control
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done in this project)
- Rotate your Supabase anon key immediately if accidentally exposed

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Current RLS policies use `USING (true)` — acceptable for development only
- **Before production deployment**: Tighten RLS policies to restrict access by `auth.uid()`
  ```sql
  -- Example: restrict cases to the owning user
  CREATE POLICY "Users can only view own cases"
    ON public.cases FOR SELECT
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id::text::uuid);
  ```

### Password Storage
- The seed data uses plain-text placeholder passwords — **replace before deploying**
- In production, use Supabase Auth for proper password hashing (bcrypt)
- Never store plaintext passwords in the database

### Supabase Service Role Key
- The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.example` is for **server-side admin scripts only**
- Never embed the service role key in client-side HTML files
- It bypasses all RLS policies — treat it like a root password

### Content Security Policy
Consider adding CSP headers via `vercel.json` for production:
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
        { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
        { "key": "Referrer-Policy", "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
