## [1.1.0] — 2026-10-30

### Added
- **Client portal** (`/client`): separate client accounts and sessions, access limited to explicitly shared cases.
- **Case timeline**: staff add hearings/orders/notes per case and choose what clients can see.
- **Notifications**: stored in the portal on every status change or notified timeline entry; optional email via Resend with generic text.
- **Admin screens**: `/admin/cases` (register + create), `/admin/cases/[id]` (status, timeline, client access, documents), `/admin/clients` (create, reset password, deactivate).
- **Configurable branding** through environment variables (name, subtitle, tagline, brand colors).
- Migration `002_client_portal.sql`; 7 additional unit tests (14 total).

### Changed
- Product positioned as case management software; the website pages are demo content.
- Case creation derives the owner from the selected court instead of a hard-coded user id.
- Fixed dead links to removed static pages (`cases.html`).

## [1.0.6] — 2026-10-29

### Security
- Split `lib/auth.ts` into `lib/auth/{token,password,revocation,session}.ts`; middleware imports only the edge-safe session module.
- Revocation now uses the service-role client, is bounded in memory, purges expired rows and **fails closed** on database errors.
- Admin password supports a scrypt hash (`ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`); constant-time comparison no longer leaks length.
- RLS: `revoked_tokens` has no anon policies; removed `USING (true)` / `authenticated` policies on private tables; anon intake is INSERT-only with a CHECK.
- Login throttle keyed by IP + email; session TTL, cookie name and limits moved to `lib/config.ts`.
- Intake endpoints no longer leak database error messages or report fake success on failure.

### Added
- `database/migrations/001_revoked_tokens.sql`, `scripts/hash-password.mjs`, auth unit tests (`npm test`), `npm run audit:prod`, CI test + audit steps.

### Removed
- Unused duplicate case action aliases and hard-coded `uploaded_by` / file size values.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-10-28

### Changed
- `database/schema.sql`: `cases` table now mirrors the live production structure (`case_no`, `plaintiff_name`, `client_mobile`, ...); removed `case_number`, `title`, `client_name`, `client_email` alias columns and the sync trigger.
- `status` is limited to `active` / `inactive` everywhere (schema, server actions, API, docs).
- `/cases` inquiry: exact `case_no` match (no raw filter string), verification by full mobile number only.
- Removed published demo passwords and hard-coded admin emails; `ADMIN_EMAIL` is now required.
- `database/seed.sql`: demo case `NEX-2026-001` uses real columns and is idempotent.
